# Math 1450 Mathematical Thinking and Quantitative Reasoning

## Course Description

The goal of Mathematical Thinking and Quantitative Reasoning is to help students develop intellectual mathematical abilities as well as see mathematics as a method to address current problems including social problems. Understanding how people learn from data will change the way students think about the world. Students will use state of the art data exploratory methods to analyze real data. Topics will include modern statistical reasoning, statistical modeling, linear regression, statistical inference, logarithmic and exponential modeling, and the conditions for inference which must hold in order to use statistical procedures.  Other topics include logical reasoning, analysis of arguments, probability.

## Prerequisites:  

None

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to ...

1. Develop capacities of quantitative reasoning to interpret, analyze, apply, and explain data (information) presented in mathematical forms.
1. Recognize and evaluate assumptions in estimation, modeling, and data analysis.
1. Calculate mathematical problems and communicate quantitative evidence in support of an argument.
1. Apply quantitative reasoning skills using data analysis, probability, and statistics through examples related to current world debates, inquiries, and problems.
1. Gain and act with confidence to work through problems using quantitative reasoning.

## Class Assignments

### Homework

You will receive homework assignments after each class session based on the topics covered in that day's class. Homework will be due the following class date.

### Data Analysis Project

Pick a dataset from the below options, and answer a question you have about the data set. What's your hypothesis? Using the techniques you learned in class, analyze the dataset to seek an answer to your question. Expect to write up a report on your findings and submit them as a google doc to the progress tracker.

**List of datasets:**

- TBD
- TBD
- TBD

**Project Due Date:** TBD 

### Math & Social Issues Project

You will pair up with a fellow student and work on a project that uses the math concepts learned in class to analyze a social issue of their choosing. Examples are given below:

- Which neighborhoods in San Francisco (or other city) have the highest rates of incarcerated youth, and what is the economic and demographic data of these communities?
- Does race determine who gets mortgage loan in Los Angeles?
- What percentage of taxes is going to each branch of government, and how is that money currently being used? How could it be used?

You will present the data, findings, and analysis through a blog post. Note that your **topic must be approved by the instructor before working on it.**

**Project Proposal Due Date:** TBD

**Project Due Date:** TBD

**Blog Post Due Date:** TBD
