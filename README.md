# Math 1450 Mathematical Thinking and Quantitative Reasoning

## Course Description

The goal of Mathematical Thinking and Quantitative Reasoning is to help you develop intellectual mathematical abilities, and see mathematics as a method to address current problems. You will use Tukey’s state of the art data exploratory methods to analyze real data and learn from your findings.

Understanding how people learn from data will change the way we think about the world. The topics you learn in this class will also help prepare you for mathmateical concepts in your technical classes, particularly those related to data science.

## Prerequisites:  

None

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to ...

1. Develop capacities of quantitative reasoning to interpret, analyze, apply, and explain data (information) presented in mathematical forms.
1. Recognize and evaluate assumptions in estimation, modeling, and data analysis.
1. Calculate mathematical problems and communicate quantitative evidence in support of an argument.
1. Apply quantitative reasoning skills using data analysis, probability, and statistics through examples related to current world debates, inquiries, and problems.
1. Gain and act with confidence to work through problems using quantitative reasoning.
